# clockbox
Arduino based clock generator for musical electronic instruments with MIDI and analog clock outputs.

Let's watch a nice little video about what it does : https://youtu.be/OYtPbgozCbE

This project use uClock by midilab : https://github.com/midilab/uClock

My addition to this code is an I2C OLED display which shows the tempo in BPM and a metronome animation which stays mostly in sync with the output. I know the code is not really clean nor optimized but I wrote this for a friend in like 4 hours.
